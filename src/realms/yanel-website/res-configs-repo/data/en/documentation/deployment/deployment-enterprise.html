In order to setup a load-balanced clustered environment, one might want to checkout the code at <a href="http://svn.wyona.com/repos/public/tomcat-cluster">http://svn.wyona.com/repos/public/tomcat-cluster</a> (U: anonymous, P: anonymous). This project includes a Java based load balancer which does support fallback (whereas the sessions are sticky as long as a single cluster node is up and running). This project also includes Apache httpd as an alternative load balancer solution.
