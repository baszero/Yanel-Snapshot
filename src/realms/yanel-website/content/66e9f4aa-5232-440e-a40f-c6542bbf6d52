<body>  <h1>Overview of Yanel Access Control Components</h1>Each Yanel realm can have its own IdentityManager and PolicyManager,Â  whereas the IdentityManager is responsible for authentication and the PolicyManager for Authorization. Additionally a Yanel realm can also have its own WebAuthenticator, which can make sense if custom HTTP headers are being used, such as for instance for Single-Sign-On solutions.<br/></body>
