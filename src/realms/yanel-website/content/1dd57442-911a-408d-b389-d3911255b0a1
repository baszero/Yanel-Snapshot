!Create a new resource from scratch

* ./build.sh new-resource
* Add new resource path to conf/yanel.xml resp. conf/local/local.yanel.xml
* Rebuild Yanel
* Restart Yanel
* Your new resource should be listed now at http://127.0.0.1:8080/yanel/

__Getting started with your new resource:__
* Implement the most recent [Viewable|http://yanel.wyona.org/javadoc/org/wyona/yanel/core/api/attributes/package-summary.html] interface. A very simple implementation example is the [World Time Resource|http://svn.wyona.com/repos/public/yanel/contributions/resources/world-time/src/java/org/wyona/yanel/impl/resources/ExampleResource.java].
* Implement the most recent Creatable interface and test it by applying the query string ?yanel.usecase=create
