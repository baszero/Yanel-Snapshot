!Create a new resource type from scratch

* ./build.sh new-resource-type
** The resource type should be created within the directory src/contributions/resources/MY_FIRST_RESOURCE_TYPE
* Register new resource within [(local.)resource-types.xml|resources/using-a-resource-type.html]
* Rebuild Yanel (./build.sh)
** Please note that a resource type can also be built on its own (e.g. ./build.sh -f src/resources/xml/build.xml), whereas one might has to update the dependencies (e.g. src/resources/xml/src/build/dependencies.xml)
* Restart Yanel (./yanel.sh start)
* Your new resource type should be listed now at http://127.0.0.1:8080/yanel/
* Starting using a new resource type within a specific realm by adding a [resource configuration|resources/using-a-resource-type.html] to the resource configuration repository of the specific realm.
