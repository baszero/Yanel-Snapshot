Options could be requested for a directory of course which probably 
would even better. Then the server would have to return directives for 
all contained resources/resource-sets or for all 
resources/resource-sets below the requested path.

That would introduce some redundancies / alternative approach to 
<navigation>. I'm not sure how to differentiate but I think it's 
imperative to deal with retrieving trees of resources/resource-sets in 
a straight forward manner. Maybe worth to consult the WebDAV specs once 
more, which is too restrictive (and at the same time fuzzy regarding 
implementation directives) in terms of handling what they call a 
"collection" in my view (see lenya WebDAV integration) - but they had 
their reasons too;)
