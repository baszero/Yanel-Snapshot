<body>  <h1>Overview of Yanel Access Control Components</h1>Each Yanel realm can have its own IdentityManager and PolicyManager,Â  whereas the IdentityManager is responsible for authentication and the PolicyManager for Authorization. Additionally a Yanel realm can also have its own WebAuthenticator, which can make sense if custom HTTP headers are being used, such as for instance for Single-Sign-On solutions.<br/><br/><h2>Authentication Usecases</h2>Yanel currently supports the following authentication usecases:<ul><li>HTTP BASIC and DIGEST<br/></li><li>Web Forms (XHTML)</li><li>Neutron</li><li>OpenID</li><li>Single-Sign-On through custom HTTP headers</li></ul>(please get in <a href="../../../mailing-lists.html">touch with the developers</a> if you have a need for another usecase)<br/><br/>Other usecases can be easily implemented by introducing a <a href="custom-identity-manager-custom-policy-manager.html">custom WebAuthenticator</a>. The actual authentication is being delegated in most cases (an exception is for instance OpenID) to the IdentityManager, whereas one can also introduce a <a href="custom-identity-manager-custom-policy-manager.html">custom IdentityManager</a> (e.g. LDAP authentication is currently done by a dedicated LDAPIdentityManager.</body>
