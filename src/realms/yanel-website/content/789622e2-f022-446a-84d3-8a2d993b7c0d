<p>Yanel should be able to update itself. </p><p>For this there is a resource-type &quot;update&quot; which provides a update-manager. this update-manager would read the install.rdf of yanel and get the update-link from it. the update-link points to a update.rdf located on the update-server [proposal1] where the updates are located. <br/></p><p>the update.rdf describes the  updates (version, compatibility, the link where to get the particular update). the update-manager compares the current version with the version provided by the update.rdf and displays all the version which the current yanel could update to. <br/></p><p>the user can choose which version she wants to update to. the update-manager then does a backup of the current yanel [problem1] downloads the war of the update version, merges the changes in the config files [problem2] (which are listed in the install.rdf) into the downloaded update and deploys it. if the user is not happy with the updated version she could revert the update. the update-manager would deploy the backup again.</p><b>problems:</b><ul><li>[problem1] to backup the current version yanel should block all request while backuping tp prevent inconsistency<br/></li><li>[problem2] to allow a merge of the config all config files should be xml rather than property files</li><li>if the update would fail and break yanel, the update-manager would not be available anymore to manage the revert. maybe the update-manager should stay in a seperate servlet.</li><li>if the update-manager should handle every servlet container complexity will increase. maybe we should limit it to tomcat which comes with the binary version.</li></ul><b>proposals:<br/></b><ul><li>[proposal1] to provide the updates resp. update.rdf  there should be a realm which contents the updates. this realm would not be included within yanel.<br/></li></ul> <br/></body>
