   <h1>Setup Yanel in Eclipse IDE</h1>
    <dl>
      <dt>Project setup</dt>
      <dd>Create new Java Project in Eclipse workspace. Use the option "Create project from existing source".</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>BUILD</dt>
      <dd>To build yanel, use ./build.sh in the console. Make sure Option "Build Automatically" is
        turned off in Eclipse. alternative: one can also use the "run external tools" to build
        inside eclipse. which is handy because you don't have to switch between shell and eclipse.
        Go to the menu Run -&gt; External Tools -&gt; Open External Tools Dialog... click
        "new Lanuch Configuration" to add a new launcher. In the main tab choose the build.xml of
        your yanel. (e.g. ${workspace_loc:/yanel-projects/src/build/build.xml}). Choose the target
        which you want to configure on the targets-tab. IMPORTANT: choose the target before you set
        the ant-home (see: <a class="external"
        href="https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=143008#c6">https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=143008#c6</a>).
        On the classpath tab add the ant shipped with yanel as ant-home.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>CLASSPATH</dt>
      <dd> Add libraries to classpath of the project. The libraries are located in
        $ECLIPSE_WORKSPACE$/yanel-trunk/local/apache-tomcat-5.5.20/webapps/yanel/WEB-INF/lib. Add
        all libraries except the ones starting with yanel-*.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>CORRECT</dt>
      <dd> Eclipse import source wizzard mixes up something with src/resources/testing-times/src.
        Remove this folder from build path and add src/resources/testing-times/src/java. Perform
        project cleanup.</dd>
    </dl>
    <dl>
      <dt>DEBUG</dt>
      <dd> Use the Eclipse Tomcat Lanucher (http://www.eclipsetotale.com/tomcatPlugin.html) which
        registers Tomcat process to Eclipse debugger.
        <br/>
        To debug Resources of a project, set a breakpoint in a resource. Eclipse will not find the
    source of the resource automatically. After it fails the first time you can use the button
    displayed "attach source" and then attach the whole resource folder of a realm.<p>also set in
      the log4j.properties the ConsoleAppender insted of the RollingFileAppender</p>
    <pre>
    log4j.appender.A1=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender 
    #log4j.appender.A1 = org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender 
    #log4j.appender.A1.File = /home/simon/src/yanel-projects/build/logs/log4j-cnode1.log
    </pre> this way you can see the output
    of the logging in the eclipse console.

      <dt>Other projects depending on Yanel</dt>
      <dd> To develop projects depending on yanel, like "Yanel contributions", add yanel-trunk as
        project dependency to this project.</dd>
