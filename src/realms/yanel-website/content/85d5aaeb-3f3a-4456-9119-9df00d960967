Take a look at the realm configuration file <i>realm.xml</i> and search for the XML element with the name &quot;rti&quot;. In the case of the &quot;from scratch&quot; realmÂ  the value should be <i>config/rti-repository.xml</i> (whereas the path is resolved relative to the file <i>realm.xml</i>). <br/></p><p>Then take a look at this file and depending on the configured repository implementation one should be able to figure out where the resource configurations are located. In the case of the &quot;from scratch&quot; realm, the resource configurations are located within the directory <i>res-configs</i>.<br/></p></body>
