    <h1>How to write tickets</h1>

<p>
The goal of creating a ticket is that it is being processed.
One is tempted to write a ticket quickly saying little about the actual task or issue.
But this is bad, because probably nobody will ever process it or even if it's processed it might not be clear if the job has actually
been completed.
No matter what issue tracking software one is using (Bugzilla, Trac, Pivotal, Jira or whatever), a ticket needs to be written by oneself.
The following questions and hints will hopefully help to write tickets such that the actual tasks will be completed successfully.
</p>

<h2>General hints and questions</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Do not add several tasks in one ticket, but rather make for each task one ticket.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Fixing stuff</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Do not just describe what is currently broken ("The favicon is not displayed"), but also describe how it should work ("This particular favicon should be displayed").</li>
</ul>
