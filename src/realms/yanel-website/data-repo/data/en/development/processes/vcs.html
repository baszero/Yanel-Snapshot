<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>
  This document aims to explain how Version Control Systems are used
  within the Yanel development process. The picture on the right should
  be understood as an example of a possible workflow, but remember that
  these are just conventions and are not set in stone. For an explanation
  of the review process, see the <a href="rtc.html">review then commit</a> page.
</p>

<h2>Subversion</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
  The central Subversion repository is located at 
  <a href="http://svn.wyona.com/repos/public/yanel/trunk/">here</a>.
  This repository always contains the <em>master</em> copy of Yanel.
  Whenever you want to make a new deployment of Yanel, use the Subversion
  repository to get the latest revision.
</p>

<h2>Mercurial</h2>

<h3>Summary</h3>

<p>
  Note: You need at least version 1.5 of Mercurial, but 1.7 is recommended.
</p>

<p>
  A Mercurial mirror of the central Subversion repository is located at
  <a href="http://hg.wyona.com/yanel-mercurial-mirror">here</a>. This mirror
  is intended for developers who would like to use Mercurial rather than 
  Subversion for their day-to-day work with Yanel. In the end, patches still
  need to be commited to the central Subversion repository however.
</p>

<h3>Technical details</h3>

<p>
For the Mercurial mirror to work correctly, three files are important (these
are all checked into the Subversion repository):
<ul>
  <li><strong>.hgignore</strong>: List of files that should be ignored</li>
  <li><strong>.hgsub</strong>: List of all subrepositories</li>
  <li><strong>.hgsubstate</strong>: Current state of subrepositories</li>
</ul>

The subrepositories file is necessary because
the Yanel Subversion repository contains other, external Subversion repositories
used to to pull in various libraries/dependencies. The existance of the 
<strong>.hgsub</strong> file will make sure that Mercurial will also automatically
make a checkout of these repositories for you. But please note that whenever a
subrepository is updated, <em>the .hgsubstate file must manually be updated
within the Subversion repository</em>. This is because the Mercurial mirror can not
check files into the central Subversion repository, and as such cannot update the
file by itself.

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Why does mercurial use the abbreviation <strong>hg</strong>? Because <strong>Hg</strong> is the symboly of the chemical element mercury :-)</li>
