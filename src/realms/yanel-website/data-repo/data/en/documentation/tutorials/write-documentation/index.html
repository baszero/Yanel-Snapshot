<h1>How-to write english documentation for Yanel<br /></h1>
<p class="tutorial_context">(Last updated June, 2011.  Tutorial written using Yanel revision 58670)</p>
<p>The purpose of this tutorial is to get started on Yanel by demonstrating a way to to create, edit and contribute documentation.  Please keep in mind that Yanel is functional but not polished.</p>
<p>This tutorial assumes that you've:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="../../../../download/source-repository.html">installed the source distibution</a> of Yanel with support for SSL in /usr/local/wyona and are able to view content in your Browser. (If you are using IE9 you might not be able to edit with one of the provided editors. Neverthelss try the second proposal.) </li>
</ul>
<h3>Create the new page/resource</h3>
<ol>
<li>Start Yanel.</li>
<li>Visit the website "http://127.0.0.1:8080/yanel/" or "http://localhost/yanel/".</li>
<li>Click on the 'Yanel Website' link in the <em>Registered Realms</em> section.</li>
<li>Click on 'Learn more about Yanel'.</li>
<li>Click on 'Documentation'.</li>
<li>Click on the link 'Toolbar' at the bottom of the page. You will be redirected a login page for the <em>Yanel Website</em> realm.</li>
<li>Enter 'alice' as your Username and 'levi' as your password.</li>
<li>After successfully logging in you will be redirected to the Documentation site with the additional Yanel 'Toolbar' on the top.</li>
<li>Take a moment to consider how your contribution fits into the existing documentation structure.<br /> You need to decide what page/resource type you want to create, where it will be placed and how to link to it.<br /><br /> For this tutorial, we will create a new tutorial called 'Adding Some Content' which will be placed at<br /> http://127.0.0.1:8080/yanel/yanel-website/en/documentation/tutorials/add-some-content/index.html</li>
<li>Select in the Yanel 'menu': file - new - Standard Page (XHTML)</li>
<li>You are redirected to the <em>first step</em> of creating a new page.<br /><br />In the 'title:' property text box enter the title that you would like to have for the page <em>Adding some content</em>. <br /><br />In 'Save as:' use the directory tree to navigate to where the new content is to be placed.  For this tutorial this means, <em>/en/documentation/</em><br /><br /> Be very careful as there are currently no warnings about overwriting. If you do overwrite something, you may want to make<br /> use of <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=subversion+revert">subversion's revert command</a> to restore what was overwritten.<br /><br /> In the 'New name:' text box enter <em>tutorials/add-some-content/index.html</em><br /><br /> Review your work and the click on the 'Save new resource' button.  This will create the resource and move you to a confirmation and summary page.</li>
<li>Now that you've created the new page/resource, you may view it by clicking on the link on the confirmation/summary page.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Edit the content</h3>
<p>There are two possibilities two edit your page. Either you alter the page in your browser or you alter the source file directly. First we will have a look at how to use the editors.</p>
<h4>1. Usage of the editors</h4>
<p>Again there's another choice to make:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you have installed Yulup, you might want to use it. Otherwise feel free to download it first (available for Firefox only) and give it a try...:D...  (You can download Yulup <a href="http://www.yulup.org/download/index.html">here</a>.)<ol>
<li>To start the Yulup editor, click on the Yulup icon on the upper right hand corner of the Firefix window.</li>
<li>Once again click on the Yulup icon and select 'Checkout and Edit "index.html". This will load the document into the Yulup editor interface.</li>
<li>Edit the document by exploring what Yulup can do.  The <em>global.css</em> for the yanel-website realm has a div class called 'instructions' <br />
<pre>&lt;div class="instructions"&gt;</pre>
that you may add via the 'Source' view in Yulup after the &lt;body&gt;-tag (or elsewhere) which will then style &lt;li&gt; and &lt;pre&gt;. <br /><br />When you are done click on the diskette icon on the Yulup toolbar and select 'Check back in to CMS and exit' to save and commit your changes. </li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Otherwise choose one of the editors provided in the Yanel 'menu'.<ol>
<li>Select in the Yanel 'menu': edit - open with -  WYSIWYG editor - edit page with XXX</li>
<li>now you need to decide if you prefer to edit your page with Xinha or tinyMCE. (Yulup will redirect you to the yulup.org, if you haven't installed it yet.)</li>
<li>According to your previous decision your document will be loaded into the editor interface.</li>
<li>Edit the document by exploring the facilities provided by the editor.</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>
<h4>2. Altering the source file</h4>
<ol>
<li>Open  the "conf" folder in your YANEL_HOME directory. (cd .../YANEL_HOME/conf)</li>
<li>There you should have a look at the "realms.xml" file. This file helps you to locate the repository you are looking for. Follow the path enclosed by the &lt;config ... /&gt;-tag. <br />(Of course consider the &lt;config&gt;-tag embedded by the realm-tag having the right "id".)</li>
<li>In this directory you will find another "realm.xml" file. It tells you (embedded by the &lt;data&gt;-tag) where the data is saved.</li>
<li>To finally find the source file, follow the directories, which are equal to the tree structure of the navigation.</li>
<li>There you are! :D..<br /> Open your source file. As you can see, it's a html file. Therefore feel free to alter the file using html until the site is ready to commit!</li>
</ol>
<p>Congratulations!  You've created and edited some new content in Yanel.</p>
<p>&#160;</p>
<h3>Contribute to the Yanel documentation</h3>
<p>If you are really working on documentation<strong> </strong>for Yanel and you have commit privileges for the project you will need to use subversion to add the content you just created.  One way of doing this is to open a shell and use the following sequence of commands:</p>
<pre>cd /usr/local/wyona/yanel-trunk/src/realms/yanel-website  <br />egrep -rio 'Adding some content' *<br /></pre>
As you don't really want to commit the results of this tutorial to the Yanel repository at Wyona, you should remove your local modifications

<p>If you are not a commiter but have created some documentation, please <a href="../../../development/processes/how-to-create-a-patch.html">create a patch</a>.</p>
<p>If you are really adding documentation to Yanel, you will need to either commit a change that links to your work or <a href="../../../development/processes/how-to-create-a-patch.html">submit a patch</a> that offers a change that will link to your work.</p>
