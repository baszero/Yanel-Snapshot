Possible bottlenecks are described below.</p><h2>Content retrieval<br/></h2>The performance of the content retrieval depends mainly on the actual persistance manager. Depending on the filesystem this is not necessarily an issue (for example one can use memory based filesystems for high performance environments), whereas in the case of databases one normally uses session pooling (also see <a href="scalability.html">Scalability</a>) and sophisticated caching mechanisms of the database solution itself.<br/><h2>Content generation</h2>The performance of the content generation depends very much on how custom resources aggregate and generate a response. Yanel doesn't set any restrictions on how this is done and performance mainly depends on the technologies a custom resource is using (for example XSLT, Jelly, POJO).<br/><h2>Access control</h2>Each request (URL) is checked for authorization.   Yanel also allows <a href="../security/overview.html">content based access control</a> which, depending upon the setup, can lead to many more authorization checks.  Fortunately Yanel allows one to use custom implementations of the access control policy manager for each realm and therefore one always has the means to improve performance.<br/></body>
