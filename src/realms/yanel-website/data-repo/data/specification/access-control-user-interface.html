[Task 5116|http://bugzilla.wyona.com/cgi-bin/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=5116]

----------------
Yanel Access Control User Interface Specification

The Access Control User Interface should provide the following features:

- Add a new user

 Usecases

 1. The chosen userId might already exist. If it does exist already, the 
 interface should inform  about the problem and ask the user 
 to choose a different userId.

 2. A user can belong to several realms. 

 If the user belongs to two or more realms, the user data
 must be stored in a single place, and each realm should be able 
 to access this information and authenticate the user.

 A user belonging to two or more realms can have different userIds
 for each realm. It is specially useful if a user with
 the same userId already belongs to one of the realms.

 3. The user interface must be able to interact with LDAP servers


- Edit an existing user
  User profiles should be accessible from certain URL. Accessing this URL
  must require authentication. From there, users must be able to modify
  their profiles and change their passwords.

- Delete users.


Implementation considerations

YanelUserResource

This resource will be responsible for the interaction with the user. It
will implement the ViewableV2 interface (editing profiles) and the CreatableV2
interface (creating new users).
