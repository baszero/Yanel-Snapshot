<h2>Resource Type Configuration Map</h2>
<p>To configure a bunch of URLs in the same way, one can use a <em>resource type configuration map</em>, which is an XML file called <code>map.rc-map</code>. This file has to be in the repository which is configured as the <em>rti (resource type identifier)</em> repository in a realm (in the file <a href="../realm/realm-configuration.html"><code>realm.xml</code></a>).</p>
<p>in this file one can define a wildcard matcher to select a group of URLs which points for every match to one <a href="resource_type_configuration.html">resource-type-configuration</a>.</p>
