<h3>Unique Selling Proposition</h3>
<p>There are a lot of Content Management Systems out there. What makes Yanel unique?</p>
<ul>
<li>Resource Framework with <a href="../javadoc/org/wyona/yanel/core/api/attributes/package-summary.html">versioned published interfaces</a> which allows continuous development and integration. This means Yanel is backwards and forwards compatible at any time.</li>
<li>Yanel cleanly separates the user interface from the server side application by using various independent protocols such as <a href="http://neutron.wyona.org/">Neutron protocol</a>, <a href="http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/">Atom Publishing Protocol</a> and <a href="http://www.webdav.org/">WebDAV</a>. This architecture allows people to use clients of their own choice (OpenOffice, Yulup, Sunbird, and others).</li>
<li>Yanel is <a href="http://svn.wyona.com/repos/public/tomcat-cluster/">clusterable</a>. Therefore maintenance can be done during production. Scalability and performance aren't an issue with a that system can be extended easily.</li>
<li>Yanel has a clean data abstraction layer implemented and hence allows access to arbitrary content repositories (for example file systems, Subversion repositories, relational and non-relational databases, or anything that can hold data). Integration into existing environments is easy and there isn't be any lock-in regarding data.</li>
<li>Separation of content and layout by using XSLT and arbitrary templating frameworks has the advantage of being able to interpret and modify them independently of each other.</li>
<li>Multiple sites can be nested arbitrarily within an instance of Yanel.</li>
<li>Reverse proxy support gives great flexibility regarding operational processes.</li>
<li>Cross-Platform (Continuously tested on Linux, Mac OS X and Windows).</li>
<li>Support of language specific URL space, e.g. /about.html (en) and /acerca.html (es) and /ueber.html (de).</li>
<li>Clean separation between repository navigation and realm (website) navigation which allows to support various navigation types, for example topic maps.</li>
</ul>
