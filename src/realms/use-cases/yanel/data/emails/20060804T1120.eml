I also feel we should introduce some naming conventions that help 
making type definitions a bit more consistent.

To illustrate what I mean we have for instance..

  - Message. Element type. Used in login.message or exception.message
  - Name. Attribute type. Used in edit.name or param.name
  - Description. Attribute type. Used in param.description

Would be nice to have some clear rules/criterions for when to use an 
element or an attribute, and possibly some seperation of GUI related 
types, as in

<edit type="someType" label="someLabel"/>

or

<edit>
   <type>someType</type>
   <label>someLabel</label>
</edit>
